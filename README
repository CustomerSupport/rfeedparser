= Tests Failed, Sort Of =

Problem: 
    Hpricot adds end tags when it sees an unclosed tag.  This means that
    certain tests that rely on Pythong's SGMLParser not closing tags will
    fail.  Many of the tests affected (actually, all the ones affected,
    AFAICT) would otherwise passed.

Tests Affected:
    * tests/wellformed/rss/item_description_not_a_doctype.xml  (extraneous trailing </a>)
    * tests/illformed/rss/item_description_not_a_doctype.xml   (ditto)

Problem:
    The Hpricot#scrub method I've written does not remove the dangerous
    markup in the same way feedparser.py does, but the output is still safe.

    * tests/wellformed/sanitize/entry_content_crazy.xml
